Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of
them belongs to a different data type.
>>> a, b, c = 1, 2.01, 'string'
>>> print(a, b, c)
1 2.01 string
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(b)
<class 'float'>
>>> type(c)
<class 'str'>
Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
x=1+2j
>>> print(x)
(1+2j)
>>> type(x)
<class 'complex'>
>>> x=10
>>> print(x)
10
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
 >>> u, v = "abc", 25
>>> print("Before swapping:\nu=", u, " \nv=", v)
Before swapping:
u= abc
v= 25
>>> temp = u
>>> u = v
>>> v = temp
>>> print("After Swapping:\nu=", u, "\nv=", v)
After Swapping:
u= 25
v= 25
Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x
Version.
>>> p=input("enter a number : ")
enter a number : 20
>>> print(p)
20
Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in
another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the
final output.
>>> q=2
>>> r=3
>>> q+r
5
>>> s=5
>>> z=5
>>> z+30
35
>>> m=35
>>> print(m)
35
Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
x = input("Enter value: ")
    if type(eval(x)) == float:
        print(x, " is floating point number")
    elif type(eval(x)) == int:
        print(x, " is integer number")          
else:
    print("That is a string")
7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and
UPPERCASE.
>>> d = "manmeetKahlon"
>>> e = "ManmeetKahlon"
>>> f = "manmeet_kahlon"
8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
Yes, the value will change because variables can consist any types of data and it can be changed multiple times.
